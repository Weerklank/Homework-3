This application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. 

The user is first prompted for how many characters between 8 and 128 they would like in their password.

Then the user is asked within a series of confirms if they would like special, numerical, uppercase, and lowercase characters.

After all the input is collected it's displayed on screen as a string of random characters within the possilbe arrays.

From there the user can manually put the characters into a password form for another website or click the copy button to copy it to their clipboard.
